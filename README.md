The process of this work

import CSV Reader
Analyze data with statistics
Send results through various graphs such as Bar Chart, Histogram, Density Plot, Pie Chart, Scatter Plot , Can Check and analyze various data.

1.CSV Reader

Pull the iris file into the CSV Reader An arrow line connecting to the Statistics node indicates that the loaded data is being analyzed statistically.

2.Statistics

Then the data from the csv reader is pulled into the statistics node, Analyze the statistical values ​​of data such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc.
Send the results to multiple nodes that are tools to display the data in graphs.

3.Bar chart

Get data from Statistics node Must have a column that is Category Data
Process and create a graph It will count the number of values ​​in the selected column 
and display it as a bar graph User can change the variable to display
Display as a bar graph Each bar represents the amount of data in each category.
Higher bars indicate more

4.Density plot

Density Plot shows the distribution of data in a curved form, showing how dense each range of data is. It is suitable for viewing the distribution and trend of data.

5. Pie chart

Pie Chart is a graph that shows data in the form of proportions or percentages of each category compared to the total data. It divides the circle into "slices", each slice representing a category of data, and the size of the slice depends on the proportion of the data in that category.

6.Statistic view

Statistics View is a tool that summarizes and displays statistical data in numerical form, allowing you to quickly understand the overall picture of the data.

7.Scatter plot

Scatter Plot is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables in the form of dots. Each dot represents a set of data, and the position of the dot on the graph is determined by the values ​​of the two variables. This helps us to see patterns, trends, and distribution of data clearly.
